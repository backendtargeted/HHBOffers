# System Patterns

## System Architecture

The application follows a layered architecture with well-defined components:

- **Frontend Layer**: React application with Material-UI, TypeScript, Redux for state management, and React Query for data fetching.
- **Backend Layer**: Node.js with Express, TypeScript, JWT authentication, role-based authorization, input validation, file upload handling, and comprehensive error handling.
- **Data Layer**: PostgreSQL for persistent data storage, Redis for caching, and Sequelize ORM for database operations.
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Docker for containerization, Nginx for reverse proxy and SSL termination, and Winston for logging.

## Key Technical Decisions

- Using TypeScript across the stack for type safety and better developer experience.
- Implementing JWT-based authentication for stateless, scalable auth.
- Using Redis for caching to improve performance of frequently accessed data.
- Implementing Repository Pattern to abstract data access and improve maintainability.
- Using Docker for consistent development and deployment environments.
- Implementing comprehensive logging and monitoring.
- Using Sequelize ORM for type-safe database operations.
- Implementing role-based access control for security.

## Design Patterns

**Backend Patterns:**

- Repository Pattern: Abstracts data access logic with BaseRepository and specific repositories.
- Strategy Pattern: Handles different file formats (CSV, XLSX) and authentication methods.
- Observer Pattern: Tracks file upload progress and notifies clients.
- Decorator Pattern: Enhances base functionality with additional features.
- Factory Pattern: Creates different types of data processors.
- Singleton Pattern: Manages database and Redis connections.
- Command Pattern: Logs and tracks data modifications.
- Batch Processing Pattern: Efficiently handles large datasets.
- Retry Pattern: Implements exponential backoff for database operations.
- Middleware Pattern: Processes requests through validation and auth checks.
- Async Handler Pattern: Standardizes error handling in async routes.
- Response Handler Pattern: Ensures consistent camelCase transformation and response formatting.

**Frontend Patterns:**

- Context API Pattern: For authentication state management
- Container/Presentational Pattern: Separating logic from UI components
- Higher-Order Component Pattern: For route protection and authorization
- Custom Hook Pattern: For reusable form logic and data fetching
- Render Props Pattern: For component composition

**API Response Pattern:**

- Standardized response handler utility
- Automatic snake_case to camelCase transformation
- Consistent success/failure wrapping
- Redis cache transformation on retrieval
- Type-safe response structures

**Data Access Patterns:**

- Connection Pool Pattern: Manages database connections efficiently.
- Cache-Aside Pattern: Implements Redis caching with automatic case transformation.
- Query Optimization Pattern: Uses proper indexing and execution plans.
- Specification Pattern: Validates data before processing.

**Security Patterns:**

- JWT Authentication Pattern: Implements stateless authentication.
- Role-Based Access Control: Manages user permissions.
- Input Validation Pattern: Prevents injection attacks.
- Rate Limiting Pattern: Controls API access.
- Password Hashing Pattern: Secures user credentials with bcrypt.

**Error Handling Patterns:**

- Error Handler Pattern: Centralizes error processing.
- Circuit Breaker Pattern: Handles service failures gracefully.
- Logging Pattern: Tracks system events and errors.
- Type-Safe Error Pattern: Ensures consistent error handling across routes.

## Component Relationships

**Frontend**: Authentication context provides user state to protected routes

- Material-UI theming provides consistent design language
- Form components use React Hook Form for validation
- Data fetching components handle loading and error states
- Navigation components enforce role-based access

## Security Measures

- Frontend route protection with authentication checks
- Input sanitization before API requests
- Token storage in localStorage with expiration handling
- Secure cookie policy for production

## Scalability and Performance

- Redis caching with automatic case transformation improves response times
- Connection pooling optimizes database performance
- Batch processing handles large file uploads efficiently
- Docker containers enable horizontal scaling

## Type Safety Patterns

- Request Handler Pattern: Ensures type safety in Express route handlers
- Controller Pattern: Standardizes async/await error handling
- Repository Pattern: Provides type-safe data access methods
- Validation Pattern: Type-safe request body validation
- Response Pattern: Type-safe API response structures
