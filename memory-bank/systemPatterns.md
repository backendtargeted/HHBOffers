# System Patterns

## System Architecture

The application follows a layered architecture with well-defined components:

- **Frontend Layer**: React application with Material-UI, TypeScript, Redux for state management, and React Query for data fetching.
- **Backend Layer**: Node.js with Express, TypeScript, JWT authentication, role-based authorization, input validation, file upload handling, and comprehensive error handling.
- **Data Layer**: PostgreSQL for persistent data storage, Redis for caching, and Sequelize ORM for database operations.
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Docker for containerization, Nginx for reverse proxy and SSL termination, and Winston for logging.

## Key Technical Decisions

- Using TypeScript across the stack for type safety and better developer experience.
- Implementing JWT-based authentication for stateless, scalable auth.
- Using Redis for caching to improve performance of frequently accessed data.
- Implementing Repository Pattern to abstract data access and improve maintainability.
- Using Docker for consistent development and deployment environments.
- Implementing comprehensive logging and monitoring.
- Using Sequelize ORM for type-safe database operations.
- Implementing role-based access control for security.

## Design Patterns

**Backend Patterns:**

- Repository Pattern: Abstracts data access logic with BaseRepository and specific repositories.
- Strategy Pattern: Handles different file formats (CSV, XLSX) and authentication methods.
- Observer Pattern: Tracks file upload progress and notifies clients.
- Decorator Pattern: Enhances base functionality with additional features.
- Factory Pattern: Creates different types of data processors.
- Singleton Pattern: Manages database and Redis connections.
- Command Pattern: Logs and tracks data modifications.
- Batch Processing Pattern: Efficiently handles large datasets.
- Retry Pattern: Implements exponential backoff for database operations.
- Middleware Pattern: Processes requests through validation and auth checks.
- Async Handler Pattern: Standardizes error handling in async routes.
- Response Handler Pattern: Ensures consistent camelCase transformation and response formatting.

**API Response Pattern:**

- Standardized response handler utility
- Automatic snake_case to camelCase transformation
- Consistent success/failure wrapping
- Redis cache transformation on retrieval
- Type-safe response structures

**Data Access Patterns:**

- Connection Pool Pattern: Manages database connections efficiently.
- Cache-Aside Pattern: Implements Redis caching with automatic case transformation.
- Query Optimization Pattern: Uses proper indexing and execution plans.
- Specification Pattern: Validates data before processing.

**Security Patterns:**

- JWT Authentication Pattern: Implements stateless authentication.
- Role-Based Access Control: Manages user permissions.
- Input Validation Pattern: Prevents injection attacks.
- Rate Limiting Pattern: Controls API access.
- Password Hashing Pattern: Secures user credentials with bcrypt.

**Error Handling Patterns:**

- Error Handler Pattern: Centralizes error processing.
- Circuit Breaker Pattern: Handles service failures gracefully.
- Logging Pattern: Tracks system events and errors.
- Type-Safe Error Pattern: Ensures consistent error handling across routes.

## Component Relationships

- **Frontend**: React components communicate with the backend API using Axios for data fetching and updates. The frontend provides the user interface for property searching, data uploading, and system monitoring. It handles user authentication and authorization, displaying data and providing feedback to the user.
- **Backend**: Express.js handles API requests, interacts with PostgreSQL using Sequelize ORM, and utilizes Redis for caching and session management.
- **Data**: PostgreSQL stores persistent data, while Redis caches frequently accessed data to improve performance.
- **Infrastructure**: Docker containers encapsulate the application, Nginx acts as a reverse proxy, and Winston provides logging.

## Security Measures

- JWT-based authentication and role-based authorization protect API endpoints.
- Input validation middleware prevents injection attacks.
- Rate limiting controls API access.
- Secure HTTP headers enhance security.

## Scalability and Performance

- Redis caching with automatic case transformation improves response times
- Connection pooling optimizes database performance
- Batch processing handles large file uploads efficiently
- Docker containers enable horizontal scaling

## Type Safety Patterns

- Request Handler Pattern: Ensures type safety in Express route handlers
- Controller Pattern: Standardizes async/await error handling
- Repository Pattern: Provides type-safe data access methods
- Validation Pattern: Type-safe request body validation
- Response Pattern: Type-safe API response structures
