# Active Context

## Active Context Updates

- Implemented Stats Controller with complete system statistics API
- Added batch update and batch create capabilities for properties
- Implemented Redis caching for dashboard data with appropriate cache invalidation strategies
- Created database initialization scripts with schema, indexes, triggers, and sample data
- Added Swagger/OpenAPI documentation with interactive UI
- Set up documentation routes at `/api/docs`
- Standardized async handler pattern for type-safe route handling
- Implemented consistent error propagation in async functions

## Current Technical Focus

- Type safety improvements in Express route handlers
- Standardization of async/await patterns
- Error handling consistency across controllers
- TypeScript configuration optimization
- API response format standardization (camelCase transformation)

## Technical Challenges Addressed

1. Express Request Handler Type Safety:

   - Implemented standardized async wrapper pattern
   - Resolved Promise<void> return type issues
   - Added proper error propagation through next()

2. Controller Type Consistency:
   - Standardized response type handling
   - Improved error type definitions
   - Enhanced middleware type safety

## Next Steps Update

Backend:

- ✅ Add statistics and dashboard endpoints
- ✅ Implement batch update capabilities
- ✅ Create database initialization scripts
- ✅ Generate API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI
- ✅ Standardize async handler pattern
- ✅ Implement type-safe route handlers

Remaining tasks:

- Write unit tests for controllers and services
- Create integration tests for API endpoints
- Create migration scripts for schema updates
- Document deployment procedures
- Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
- Implement comprehensive error boundary testing
- Add type coverage reporting to test suite

Frontend tasks remain unchanged.

## Current Focus Areas

1. Type Safety:

   - Continuing to improve type definitions
   - Enhancing controller return type consistency
   - Implementing stricter type checking

2. Error Handling:

   - Standardizing error propagation
   - Improving error type definitions
   - Enhancing error logging

3. Testing:
   - Planning type safety test coverage
   - Designing integration test strategy
   - Preparing error boundary tests

## Implementation Notes

- Async handler pattern now standardized across all routes
- Type-safe error propagation implemented
- Controller return types properly typed
- Express middleware chain type safety improved
- Response handler utility created for consistent camelCase transformation
- Redis cache layer updated to transform data on retrieval

## Current Technical Blockers

1. Type mismatch in route handlers
2. Express type definitions vs controller implementations
3. Circular import warnings in TS compilation

## Proposed Solution Path

1. Standardize async handler pattern
2. Update controller return types to `Promise<void>`
3. Add @types/express-async-handler
