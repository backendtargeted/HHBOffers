# Progress

## What Works

Backend Core:

- Created project repository with proper .gitignore and README
- Initialized backend project structure using Express.js
- Set up TypeScript configuration for type safety
- Configured ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- Set up Jest for unit testing with coverage reporting
- Configured environment variables using dotenv
- Set up logging infrastructure with Winston
- Implemented standardized async handler pattern
- Enhanced type safety across route handlers

Authentication & Security:

- Implemented JWT-based authentication system
- Created role-based authorization middleware
- Set up user login, registration, and logout endpoints
- Integrated bcrypt password hashing
- Added input validation with express-validator
- Enhanced server security with Helmet, rate limiting, and CORS

Data Management:

- Created SQL migration scripts for database schema with proper indexes
- Configured database connection pooling with Sequelize and retry mechanisms
- Implemented Redis service for caching and session management
- Set up cache invalidation strategies for data consistency
- Created Sequelize ORM models with validation rules:
  - User Model: With role-based permissions and secure password handling
  - Property Model: With address field validation and normalization
  - UploadJob Model: With job status tracking and progress reporting
  - ActivityLog Model: With comprehensive audit capabilities

File Processing:

- Implemented upload-middleware.ts using Multer
- Added file type validation and size limits
- Set up temporary and processed file storage
- Enhanced FileProcessorService with:
  - Repository integration for data persistence
  - Observer Pattern for real-time progress tracking
  - Support for both CSV and XLSX file formats
  - Batch processing for efficiency with large files

API Layer:

- Created comprehensive API routes with role-based access
- Implemented property-controller.ts for CRUD operations
- Created upload-controller.ts for file handling
- Added proper error handling and logging throughout controllers
- Standardized async/await error handling
- Implemented type-safe route handlers

Repository Layer:

- Implemented Repository Pattern for data access:
  - BaseRepository: Generic implementation for common CRUD operations
  - UserRepository: User-specific queries and authentication helpers
  - PropertyRepository: Address-based deduplication and search
  - UploadJobRepository: Job management and statistics
  - ActivityLogRepository: Audit logging and reporting

Development Environment:

- Created Docker configuration for development
- Set up development Dockerfiles for both frontend and backend
- Initialized frontend project using React and TypeScript

## What Works (New Additions)

Backend:

- Stats API fully implemented with Redis caching:
  - System overview statistics
  - Property statistics by state
  - Property statistics by city
  - User activity statistics
  - Upload statistics
- Batch property operations:
  - Batch update for modifying multiple properties
  - Batch create for importing new properties
  - Proper validation for batch operations
  - Comprehensive error handling and reporting
- Database initialization scripts:
  - Table creation with proper constraints
  - Index creation for optimized queries
  - Trigger setup for automatic timestamp updates
  - Sample data creation for testing
- API Documentation:
  - Swagger/OpenAPI specification
  - Interactive documentation UI
  - Endpoint descriptions and examples
  - Request/response schema definitions
- Type Safety Improvements:
  - Standardized async handler pattern
  - Enhanced route handler type safety
  - Improved error propagation
  - Consistent controller return types

## What's Left to Build

Backend Tasks:

- Write unit tests for controllers and services
- Create integration tests for API endpoints
- Create migration scripts for schema updates
- Document deployment procedures
- Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
- Add type coverage reporting
- Implement error boundary testing

Frontend tasks remain unchanged.

## Current Status

Backend Progress:

- Core authentication and authorization system implemented
- File upload processing system in place with progress tracking
- Data access layer established with Repository Pattern
- Redis caching integrated for performance optimization
- API endpoints created for core functionality
- Security measures implemented including JWT, input validation, and rate limiting
- Type safety improvements implemented across route handlers
- Standardized async/await error handling pattern established

Frontend Progress:

- Project initialized with React and TypeScript
- Development environment configured with Docker
- Ready for component development

## Known Issues

Performance:

- Need to optimize Redis caching strategies for specific use cases
- Potential bottlenecks with concurrent large file uploads
- Database query optimization needed for complex searches

Security:

- Need to implement additional rate limiting for specific endpoints
- Required security audit for JWT implementation
- CORS configuration needs review for production

Testing:

- Lack of comprehensive test coverage
- Need integration tests for critical paths
- Required load testing for file upload system
- Type safety test coverage needed
- Error boundary testing required

Frontend:

- Need to implement client-side validations
- Required error handling strategy for API interactions
- Performance optimization needed for large datasets
